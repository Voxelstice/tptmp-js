# tptmp-js
The Powder Toy Multiplayer Server, coded in Javascript. A good alternative if you dont have Linux.

Original server code: https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/tptmp

# Running the server
As of now, the entire thing is a WIP. Check this section later when it's done.
If you know how to run node.js projects by yourself without a guide, then all you need to know is that you just install the required packages.
