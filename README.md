# tptmp-js
The Powder Toy Multiplayer Server, coded in Javascript. A good alternative if you dont have Linux. This is also made to be ran with nodemon for the remote console stuff commands or whatever.

Original server code: https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/tptmp

# Running the server
As of now, the entire thing is a WIP. Check this section later when it's done.

why i made this public? just so people can see the progress if they want to

If you know how to run node.js projects by yourself without a guide, then all you need to know is that you just install the required packages.

The server still can be ran, just that you can't join it yet. The reason of this is because nothing else happens after the handshake.

Oh by the way the server port is 3000
